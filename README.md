# Design and Modeling of a V6 Engine Crankshaft in Blender

## 📖 Introduction
This project focuses on the **3D design and modeling** of a **V6 engine crankshaft and pistons** using **Blender** (v2.78). The goal was to understand the intricate geometry of a crankshaft and its interaction with pistons, without designing the complete engine block.

## 🔥 About the V6 Engine
- A **V6 engine** has six cylinders arranged in a "V" shape (two banks of three cylinders).
- **Key Features:**
  - Compact and space-efficient design.
  - Good balance between performance and fuel economy.
  - Smoother operation compared to inline-four engines.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Visualize the arrangement and mechanical movement of pistons and crankshaft.
- Create a simulation-ready 3D model.
- Improve CAD modeling skills using Blender.
- Enhance understanding of mechanical design principles like balancing and stroke.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Software:** Blender v2.78
- **Units:** Metric (for realistic scaling)

## 🏗️ Design Process

### Step 1: Blender Setup
- Open Blender and set measurement units to Metric.

### Step 2: Crankshaft Modeling
- Model the main shaft using a cylinder.
- Add crankpins at accurate angles to form offset sections for piston connections.
- Shape the crank arms using extrude, rotate, and translate operations.
- Add realistic counterweights for balancing.

### Step 3: Piston Design
- Model pistons separately using cylinders.
- Include features like piston heads, pinholes, and skirt designs.
- (Optional) Add simplified connecting rods.

### Step 4: Assembly
- Align pistons correctly with each crankpin based on a real V6 crankshaft layout.

### Step 5: Finishing Touches
- Optimize mesh by removing unnecessary faces.
- Apply smooth shading and optionally use **Subdivision Surface Modifier** for finer detailing.

## 📸 Visuals
- 2D sketches and 3D rendered images of parts and assemblies.
- Assembly showcasing piston and crankshaft arrangement.

## 📋 Observations
- Manual modeling helps deeply understand crank angles, throw distances, and piston timing.
- Blender, though primarily an artistic tool, is quite capable for basic mechanical visualizations.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the **3D modeling** of a V6 engine's **crankshaft and pistons**. While the engine block was not modeled, the project offers a strong foundation for understanding engine dynamics.  
**Future work** could involve animating the crankshaft-piston motion and adding mechanical components like bearings and engine casing.
